This Tetris game was developed as part of my **Programming II** class. It is a classic block-stacking puzzle game where the player must arrange falling shapes to complete full rows and earn points.

## Features

- **Shape Movement**: Move shapes left, right, and down.
- **Rotation**: Rotate shapes to fit them into place.
- **Next Shape Preview**: See the upcoming shape to plan ahead.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's score.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: The game speeds up as the player advances.

## Future Improvements

- **Row Clearing**: When a row is filled, it should disappear, and the blocks above should move down.
- **Enhanced UI**: Improve the visual appeal of the game.
- **Sound Effects**: Add sound effects for actions like rotating, clearing rows, and game over.

## Installation
